## Key Findings about Hospitality Domain:
There were a lot of terms I wasn't familiar with prevalent in hospitality domain. These terms are-

1. RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)
This metric is used to measure hotel performance by multiplying hotel's Average Daily Room Rate (ADR) by its Occupancy Rate. It can also be calculated by dividing the Total Revenue by the Number of Rooms Available. 

2. ADR (Average Daily Rate)
This metric indicates the average revenue earned for an occupied room on a given day.

3. Occupancy Rate
This ratio indicates the ratio of occupied to total usable rental space.

## Performance Metrics
1. DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights)
This metric indicates the total number of hotel rooms available for sale on a given day. This excludes rooms under maintenance, long-term holds, or any other non-sellable inventory.
   
2. DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights)
This metric indicates the total number of room nights that have been booked for a particular day, regardless of whether they are utilized or later canceled.

3. DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights)
This metric indicates the total number of room nights that were actually occupied and utilized by guests on a given day. This excludes cancellations and no-shows.

4. Realisation
This metric indicate the actual revenue or yield generated per booking after accounting for discounts, cancellations, and other adjustments. It often refers to the percentage of booked revenue that is successfully realized.
  
5. Cancellation
This metric indicates total number of bookings that were canceled before the stay date. This can be expressed as a number or a percentage of total bookings.
