# Data-Analysis-in-Hospitality-Domain

Did you know that in the hospitality domain, Friday and Saturday are considered weekends, while the rest of the days are counted as weekdays?

# Metrics used for Hospitality Domain:
While working with hospitality data, I encountered several industry-specific terms that were unfamiliar to me. Here are some key metrics used in the hospitality domain:

## Metrics

1. RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)
This metric measures hotel performance by multiplying the hotel's Average Daily Rate (ADR) by its Occupancy Rate. It can also be calculated by dividing the total revenue by the number of available rooms.

2. ADR (Average Daily Rate)
This metric indicates the average revenue earned per occupied room on a given day.

3. Occupancy Rate
This metric represents the ratio of occupied rooms to the total number of usable rental spaces.

## Performance Metrics
1. DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights)
This metric indicates the total number of hotel rooms available for sale on a given day. This excludes rooms under maintenance, long-term holds, or any other non-sellable inventory.
   
2. DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights)
This metric indicates the total number of room nights that have been booked for a particular day, regardless of whether they are utilized or later canceled.

3. DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights)
This metric indicates the total number of room nights that were actually occupied and utilized by guests on a given day. This excludes cancellations and no-shows.

4. Realisation
This metric indicates the actual revenue or yield generated per booking after accounting for discounts, cancellations, and other adjustments. It often refers to the percentage of booked revenue that is successfully realized.
  
5. Cancellation
This metric indicates total number of bookings that were canceled before the stay date. This can be expressed as a number or a percentage of total bookings.
